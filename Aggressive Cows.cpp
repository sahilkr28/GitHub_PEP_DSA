// You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the positions of stalls. 
// You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
// The task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

// Examples:

// Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], 
// the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and 
// the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
// The minimum distance between cows in this case is 3, which is the largest among all possible ways.
// Input: stalls[] = [10, 1, 2, 7, 5], k = 3
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0],
// the second cow can be placed at stalls[1] and
// the third cow can be placed at stalls[4].
// The minimum distance between cows in this case is 4, which is the largest among all possible ways.
// Input: stalls[] = [2, 12, 11, 3, 26, 7], k = 5
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There are 6 stalls and only 5 cows, we try to place the cows such that the minimum distance 
// between any two cows is as large as possible.
// The minimum distance between cows in this case is 1, which is the largest among all possible ways.
// Constraints:
// 2 ≤ stalls.size() ≤ 106
// 0 ≤ stalls[i] ≤ 108
// 2 ≤ k ≤ stalls.size()
